Mirror
======

Mirror is intended to be a ready-to-use interface between the programmer and IndexedDB API.
Although is still in progress I'm publishing it because I think is ready for simple webapps. I'll be adding new features
as soon as I can. The next features will be:

~~Inner join~~  
DONE!

~~Multiple inner join (after I complete the first one)~~  
SO DONE!

New methos added!
=====

```javascript
.select
.innerjoin
```
